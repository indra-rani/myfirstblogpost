<h1> My First Blog Post</h1>
<h2> Originator of HTML</h2> 

<p> In 1980, physicist <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong> , a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based <u>hypertext system</u> .[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. <br>
  That year, Berners-Lee and <em>CERN</em>  data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes[4] from 1990 he listed[5] "some of the many are
  as in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.</p>

<p>The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[6][7] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. <br>
  Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.[8]</p>
